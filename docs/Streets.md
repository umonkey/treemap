# Street addresses

Trees can be associated with a street by name.
This information is mostly used for analytics and reporting.

## How street address is added

The address is first set automatically when a tree is added to the map.
Internally, we use the OSM's Nominatim service to get street address.
After that, the address is never updated automatically, and can be edited manually.
